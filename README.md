A simple and clean **online library** web app where you can add your favorite books with their title, author, and year — all managed in your browser with JavaScript!

## ✨ Features

- **Add Books**  git push origin main

  Easily add books with their title, author, and publication year.

- **Persistent Storage**  
  Your books are saved in your browser’s **localStorage** — so even if you refresh the page or close your browser, your library stays safe!

- **Clean & Modern UI**  
  Minimal interface for a fast and distraction-free experience.

- **No Backend Needed**  
  All the logic and storage run entirely in the browser. No database, no server!

## 🚀 How It Works

2. **Click "Add Book"**: The book appears below in the book list table.
3. **Refresh-Proof**: All your added books will stay there, even after refreshing or reopening the site (thanks to localStorage).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
